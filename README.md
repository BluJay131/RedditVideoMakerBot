(Side note this works only on the Windows OS)

## Description

An easy way to automagically upload the created videos using pyautogui and openCV on a schedule!

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the scripts batch files and "upload.py".
2. Install the required Python libraries using the following command:
    ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Edit path variables in upload.py (line 6) and StartAll.bat (line 1) to be your corresponding paths
   
(Make sure the upload.py folder is the subreddit's results folder and the StartAll.bat folder is just the repo folder)

4. Make sure to either change your windows and chrome theme to dark gray or change the images in the uploadImages folder to reflect your desktop
5. Also, set view in file explorer to "list" and use Windows media player to open videos
   
If your environment is set up correctly, when you use upload.bat the python file should launch, upload the video to YT studio, update the COPPA agreement and publish, after this go into file explorer and delete the video.

## Side Notes
I am aware it is an inconvenience to set all of these settings up so I decided to go the route of using my home server with Task Scheduler to create and publish videos 5 times in a span of 24 hours, idk how long I'll upkeep my server in this regard but they are posted to the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4XvDmn7p5vo_XpwlIg54TA">channel here.</a>
